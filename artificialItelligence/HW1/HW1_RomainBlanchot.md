1. Performance Measure (P)
This refers to the criteria for evaluating the agent's success.
For an autonomous vacuum cleaner, performance is measured by:

Amount of dirt removed
Coverage of the floor area
Battery efficiency (how long it runs before needing to recharge)
Avoiding obstacles without getting stuck
Noise levels (lower is better)
2. Environment (E)
This includes everything the agent interacts with.
For a vacuum cleaner, the environment consists of:

Various types of flooring (tiles, carpets, hardwood)
Obstacles like furniture, walls, and stairs
People and pets moving around
Different levels of lighting
3. Actuators (A)
These are the components that allow the agent to take action.
For a vacuum cleaner, actuators include:

Wheels for movement
Brushes and suction mechanisms for cleaning
A motor for suction power
A dustbin for storing dirt
A speaker (for alerts or beeps)
4. Sensors (S)
Sensors allow the agent to perceive its environment and make decisions.
For a vacuum cleaner, sensors include:

Bump sensors (to detect collisions)
Dirt sensors (to detect high-dirt areas and focus on them)
Cliff sensors (to detect stairs or edges and avoid falling)
Optical sensors (to map the area and navigate efficiently)
Battery level sensor (to return to the charging dock when needed)
