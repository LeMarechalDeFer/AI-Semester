## PEAS

PEAS (Performance measure, Environment, Actuators, and Sensors) => framework to define the characteristics of intelligent agents, such as robots.

1. Identify the Goal (Performance Measure)
What is the main objective of the robot?
How do we determine whether the robot is performing well?
What factors contribute to the success or failure of its task?

2. Define the Operating Conditions (Environment)
Where does the robot operate?
What kind of obstacles, objects, or external factors affect its behavior?
Is the environment static (unchanging) or dynamic (changes frequently)?

3. List the Actions It Can Take (Actuators)
What physical components allow the robot to perform actions?
What movements or mechanisms does it use to interact with its environment?
Does it have arms, legs, wheels, or tools for its task?

4. Determine How It Perceives the Environment (Sensors)
What types of sensors does the robot use to collect data?
How does it recognize obstacles, people, or environmental changes?
Does it use cameras, LiDAR, GPS, touch sensors, or temperature sensors?


✅ What is its main purpose? → Defines Performance Measures
✅ Where does it operate? → Defines Environment
✅ How does it move/interact? → Defines Actuators
✅ How does it sense its surroundings? → Defines Sensors
